# Pivot and Transform Orientation Menu

A concise menu that combines the pivot and transform orientation options into one place. The key bind is `4` by default. Also includes the "auto toggle move gizmo" functionality from the addon below.

# Auto Toggle Move Gizmo

Automatically toggles the "move" gizmo when Transform Orientation is not Global. This lets you get a visual indication of which axes are which.

# Auto Collection Instance Offset

Automatically sets collections' instance offset property based on member objects. This makes collection instances and linked collections have their origin always in sync with the root object. To exclude a collection from this behavior, add custom property "Manual Offset" set to True on the collection.

# ID Map Express
Easily create ID Maps for your models in Blender directly from Edit mode. Select some faces and then assign them a new, unused color in one click.

This is a simple addon that removes the friction involved in manually assigning ID colors to faces. Having to use the paint brush in Vertex Paint mode is imprecise, and the Vertex Paint face selection lacks quality of life features from Edit mode. And picking a color manually can be error prone and tedious.

ID Map Express automates this process, along with automatically selecting a color that isn't close to any other color in your active collection.
